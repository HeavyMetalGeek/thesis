# **Thesis Research Using OpenFOAM**

----------
This repository contains a record of the basic setup for the simulations used in my research.  Eventually all cases will contain their own results report, as well.  
----------

Cases
-----
* nWind - A simulation attempting to develop a vertical velocity profile matching the log-law, utilizing most of the parameters within the master's thesis of Timothy Stovall.
* nist - A simulation attempting to reproduce the vertical velocity profile and statistical results of the NIST Technical Note 1944, by Dr. Shi and Dr. Yeo.
* nist_asce - A simulation attempting to reproduce the vertical velocity profile and statistical results of Dr. Shi and Dr. Yeo
* hipecc - Bash scripts used on the Wichita State University High Performance Computing Center.
* python - Python scripts used.
